# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

Installation instructions, run from file milestone_5

Licence is open

"Milestone" files build on one another to show the progression of the task (Milestone_1 was setting up the Git Hub and environment etc)

A text based (no graphics) hangman game that can be run in the terminal.
The aim of the project was to learn how to use a CLASS structure for coding, to make code neater and more efficient, and to practice using functions within a Class.
I learned a lot, mainly to take my time and not get too frustrated when something doesn't go quite to plan.
